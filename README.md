Created a full-stack Employee Management System CRUD web application to manage employee records. 

Used Spring Boot, React (Functional Components and Hooks), and MySQL.

Built RESTful APIs for the backend and tested them with Postman. 

Connected them to the React frontend with Axios to carry out Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
